Learning Solidity
A lot of the code here is done through reading the documents and using Solidity by Example. 
The reason that is the case is because I really have no conceptual idea how to develop particular products
And I feel that Solidity by Example, as well as the documents are the best way to look at Solidity through the lens of creating products for the public domain.
